## Red Circle Detection
- First basic implementation of detecting the red circles (vulnerabilities) that will be on the provided Death Star images

## Test Object Detection (stop-signs)
- A test using a given, pre-existing image classifier for stop-signs to detect them in images. Will prove useful if we can create our own classifier for the Death Star and build off of it.
- Code and classifier taken from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-an-object-with-opencv-python/#)
